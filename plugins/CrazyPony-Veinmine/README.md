With Veinmine you're able to mine the whole ore/rock vein at once!  
You can do this by holding down the assigned key (Left Alt by default) while mining!

## **Version 1.0.0 - Progressive mode added!**

### **Please delete your previous config when updating as it might break something.**

You can now enable progressive mode in the config, making it so veinmining is scaled by your Pickaxes level. This is intended to be a less OP way of veinmining, where the tradeoff is taking higher durability damage (and less xp) than if you mined manually.

The radius of the veinmined area is also scaled by your Pickaxes level.  
  
It works by checking for rocks in a radius set by the Progressive Level Multiplier value in the config. This value is multiplied by your Pickaxes level to obtain a radius.  
  
By default, it's set to 0.1 so assuming your Pickaxes level is 20, the radius will be 0.1 * 20 = 2.  
  
What does 2 mean, you ask?  
  
It's simple! A standard 2x2 floor piece has a length of 2, exactly like its name suggests.

### 1.2.3
 - Fixed a bug that allowed players to veinmine (and gain exp) without a pickaxe.
### 1.2.2
 - Possible fix for ore drop quantities (Not sure why they weren't correct, as I don't change drop rates)
### 1.2.1
 - Compatibility for Hearth and Home;
 - Tentative fix for ores spawning at 0,0 (unable to test without other players)
### 1.2.0
 - Replaced 'Even' spread damage option with 'Level' as even was useless when the mined vein had a large number of sections.
 - Refactored code. 
### 1.1.9
 - Fixed incompatibility with Rocky Ore mod.
### 1.1.8
 - Fixed a bug that was causing no ores to be dropped (hopefully)
### 1.1.7
 - Fixed a bug that caused ores to drop every single pickaxe swing when mining manually.
### 1.1.6
 - Fixed a bug that was causing no drops to be received when veinmining.
### 1.1.5
#### Please delete your previous config when updating to this version.
 - Damage text when veinmining should now display on top of each rock section
 - Veinmining when Progressive mode is disabled is now instant
 - Spread damage now has two options: Even and Distance
	 - Even is the same as previous versions
	 - Distance makes it so the damage dealt to a rock section is based on distance. The farther away a section is, the less damage is dealt.

### 1.1.4
 - Fixed a bug where if you had spread damage enabled, mining damage would also be reduced when mining manually.
### 1.1.3
 - Added config option for spreading damage in progressive mode (divides your mining damage equally between all rock sections affected, as opposed to doing full damage to all sections)
 - This is disabled by default.
### 1.1.2
 - Fixed incompatibility with mods that alter the pickaxe's durability drain values. The value modified by such mods (m_useDurabilityDrain) is now multiplied by the result of the previous formula (which is shown in the config). Take this into account when editing this mod's durability modifier.
### 1.1.1
 - Added config options for durability and xp multipliers for Progressive mode.
### 1.1.0
 - Durability taken is now scaled to the player's Pickaxes level when Progressive mode is enabled. This is meant to (somewhat) balance veinmining so it fits in with vanilla.
 - The formula is (120 - Level) / 20, so if you have level 50: (120 - 50) / 20 = 3.5 durability taken **per rock section veinmined**
### 1.0.1
 - Removed log messages to avoid spam.
### 1.0.0
 - Added Progressive mode.
#### 0.0.1.4
 - Fixed a bug that allowed monsters to veinmine and/or give XP to the    player.
#### 0.0.1.3
 -   Indestructible items no longer lose durability. (such as items from Epic Loot)
 -   Added config option to disable mining visual effects, which *might* help reduce fps lag. (disabled by default)

 -   Added config option for veinmining to take pickaxe durability for each section mined (default = true).
 -   XP is now only awarded if the section mined wasn't already destroyed.
 -   Fixed a NullReferenceException thrown when there were more than 128 rock sections.
#### 0.0.1.1
 - Mining xp is now awarded for every rock section mined.
#### 0.0.1.0
 - Initial release
