# Forsaken Powers Plus

<b>by TastyChickenLegs</b>

This is partly from CakeBlood and RathorDax's ChangeForsakenPowers and Passive Powers mods.  I basically rewrote the entire mod.

Idea credited back to them.

Change the forsaken powers and modify the duration and cooldown.

- Now with ServerSync - ability to turn off version check
- Enable all bosses at once or just the ones you want.
- complied with Mistlandâ€™s Final Release 0.212.7
- Complete rewrite of code
- Able to cycle through the forsaken powers to chose which one to use
- Can see all powers or just the one's you have earned
- Can change the durration and cooldown timers
- Can reset current power and startt a new one - even stack powers

```
To Stack Powers do the Following

In the options disable "enable reset"
Hit F and activate your power
HIt F9 to reset the power - Resetting just does not turn off the old power it just allows for a new one.
Hit F8 to cycle through the powers to select a new power
Hit F to start the new power.  They are now stacked as in the image
```

Install the mod into your Bepinex\Plugins and start the game.
Config file will be generated in the Bepinex\Config folder.
