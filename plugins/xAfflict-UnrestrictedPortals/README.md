_**What is it?:**_

Unrestricted Portals is a mod that allows players to take any item through portals. The mod is highly customizable, allowing players to restrict or unrestrict every individual item.

_**Why install it?:**_

Because Valheim has so many resources that are separated by tons of land and water, it makes grinding certain resources a pain. Having to go from one point ï»¿to another takes lots of time. It is a useless grind. The developers fixed this by adding portals. This would be a solution, but they then blacklisted certain items. The blacklist of certain items forced players to go back to doing the useless grind.

If you think being able to take every item across portals is too overpowered or easy, then you can edit the configuration file to:


- Make every item teleportable. (Can be overridden by individual item entries .)
- Make every item unteleportable. (Can be overridden by individual item entries.)
- Make individual items teleportable.
- Make individual items unteleportable.
