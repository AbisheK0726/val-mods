  * ItemSets have been added to the loot table schema (If the "Item" field of the Loot list is in the item set, roll on that loot table for that item instead)	
  * Can now reference other loot tables in the loot table item config using "Item": "`object`.`level`" where `object` is the name of a loot table entry and `level` is an integer between 1 and 3 that refers to Loot, Loot2, or Loot3.	
  * Number of magic effects per rarity is now configurable in loottables.json in the "MagicEffectsCount" object
