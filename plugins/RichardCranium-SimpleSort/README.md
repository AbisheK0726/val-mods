<br/>

>About this mod

This mod offers a simple way to sort the player and container inventory, by hovering over the inventory and pressing a customizable key combination of a modifier key and a sort type key.

It also now allows the sort type to stick for either inventory type and get applied each time you open the inventory.

Sort types are:

by <b>name</b> (default key: N)
by <b>weight</b> (default key: H)
by <b>value</b> (default key: V)
